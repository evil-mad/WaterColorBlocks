WaterColorBlocks
================

Code examples for driving the WaterColorBot from within block-based programming languages like Scratch and Snap!

##Current project status:

The Snap! interface and examples are tested, and behave very well.  We :heart: Snap!


The Scratch examples are not currently working. They worked well as of Scratch version 404.  However, the Scratch team has partially disabled the extension interface. Unless you care to download the older version of Scratch, please consider these examples to be broken. We will revisit this once the Scratch team (1) updates their documentation, (2) restores the functionality, or (3) lets us into their developer program.



## The helper app:
Currently requires "current" version of CNCserver:  https://github.com/techninja/cncserver

Run CNCserver in background, launched with command:

  node cncserver
  
*In the near future*, this will get a lot easier. RoboPaint ( https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint ) will include this version of CNCserver, and you will only need to launch RoboPaint (a regular Mac/Win/Linux application) and let it run in the background.
