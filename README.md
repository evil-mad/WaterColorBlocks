WaterColorBlocks
================

Code examples for driving the WaterColorBot from within block-based programming languages like Scratch and Snap!

##Current project status:

The Snap! examples are tested, and behave very well.

The Scratch examples work well, but are a version behind.



## The helper app:
Currently requires "current" version of CNCserver:  https://github.com/techninja/cncserver

Run CNCserver in background, launched with command:

  node cncserver --botType=watercolorbot 
  
*In the near future*, this will get a lot easier. RoboPaint ( https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint ) will include this version of CNCserver, and you will only need to launch RoboPaint (a regular Mac/Win/Linux application) and let it run in the background.
