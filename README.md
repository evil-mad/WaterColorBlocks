WaterColorBlocks
================

Code examples for driving the WaterColorBot from within block-based programming languages like Scratch and Snap!

_Current project status:_

The Snap! examples are tested, and behave very well.
The Scratch examples work well, but are a version behind.



_Helper app:_
Currently requires "current" version of CNCserver:  https://github.com/techninja/cncserver

Run CNCserver in background, launched with command:

  node cncserver --botType=watercolorbot 
  
In the near future, RoboPaint will include this version of CNCserver, and you will only need to launch RoboPaint (a regular Mac/Win/Linux application) and let it run in the background.
